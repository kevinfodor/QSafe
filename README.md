# QSafe
An Electronic Safe application based on the Quantum Platform Framework


QSafe is a simple implementation of an Electronic Safe much like those found in hotel rooms to help guests keep their valuables secure while not in their rooms (Figure 1). More importantly the QSafe application was created to take a simple real-world device and model it’s control software as a hierarchical state machine (HSM) using the Quantum Framework. The foremost purpose of this exercise was to familiarize one’s self with the Quantum Platform’s methodology, and framework.
